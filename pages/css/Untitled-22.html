It has one of the largest oases in the world with Date Palms known to be the best in the world, the oasis is located about 60 km inland from the Persian Gulf. All urban areas are located in the traditional oasis of Al-Hasa. In addition to the oasis, the county also includes the giant Empty Quarter desert, making it the largest governorate in Saudi Arabia in terms of area. The Empty Quarter has the world's largest oil fields and connects Saudi Arabia to Qatar, the UAE, and Oman. The Governorate's population is over 1,100,000 (2010 estimate).In the past, Al-Ahsa belonged to the historical region known as Bahrain, along with Qatif and the present-day Bahrain islands.

        Jabl Al-Qarah (Arabic = جبل القارة, which means mountain of Al-Qarah) is a mesa that stands about 75 metres (246 ft) above Al-Qarah village.[1] It has many caves with very cool air inside. Unlike many caves, these were formed by subaerial weathering rather than dissolution, and as a result have a highly distinctive shape.[1] The mountain attracts many people especially from nearby villages, and has been targeted for additional tourist development.[2] Although there are no other hills for a considerable distance,[3] Jabl Al-Qarah is an outlier of the larger Shedgum Plateau.[1]

The caves, which include 28 tall linear passageways totaling 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) in length, have long been a site of commerce.[1] Some caves of Jabl Al-Garah have traditionally been the site of the workshops of local traditional potters, who are known for the quality of their wares.[4][3]

            A plaque about the mountain and a parking lot near the main access trail is at 25.411509°N 49.692755°E.abl Al-Qarah (Arabic = جبل القارة, which means mountain of Al-Qarah) is a mesa that stands about 75 metres (246 ft) above Al-Qarah village.[1] It has many caves with very cool air inside.
